## Proposed structure

directories :
* data : contains the datasets
* images : images generated or used in the notebooks
* python_notebooks
* R_notebooks
* slides : pptx / pdf of introductory slides 

## TODO

todo list :
 * "translate" python notebooks to R
 	* chapter 1
 	* chapter 2
 	* chapter 3
 	* chapter 4
 * add something on neural networks ?
 * change datasets to more biological ones
